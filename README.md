1. Customer Segmentation: Apply RFM analysis to divide customers into segments based on their buying habits, aiming to personalize marketing to each group.
2. Identifying Key Customers: Focus on customers with the best recent, frequent, and high-value purchases to strengthen loyalty.
3. Boosting Retention: Use RFM insights for strategies that increase loyalty and reduce churn, keeping customers engaged longer.
4. Create customer potential analysis for next 90 days transaction.

## Result
![result](overview-result.png)
What we can do from this strategy :

1. From customers with a high probability of repurchase, we can do a more detailed analysis of the products they often buy for product development.

2. We assume this model works well enough, so that we can see customers with a high probability of repurchase but not repurchase. We can take mitigation actions to prevent customer loss.

3. We can see high value customers (based on our customer segmentation), but no purchase or low repurchase probability. We can try to attract them back, because they are our big spenders after all.

4. We can see medium value customers (based on our customer segmentation), but no purchase or low repurchase probability. They are our loyal customers, so we need to take incentive actions to prevent losing our loyal customers.
